# Web Scrape - alltrails.com

Organised a camp to Mont-Orford National Park in 2019 Sep. We wanted to do a few hikes, 
hence, wanted a way to have an overview of the trails near [Mont-Orford National Park](https://www.alltrails.com/parks/canada/quebec/mont-orford-national-park)

## Problem

The site [alltrails.com](https://www.alltrails.com) doesn't present an overview of relevant trails with rich data =\

| --- | --- |
| The closest overview of the trails was that of a side bar with summary information for each trail | <img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/7044060/64193464-c9cbf700-ce4a-11e9-9ca6-612bffde003f.png" width="500"> | 



## Solution

The solution was to scrape the data from [alltrails.com](https://www.alltrails.com) and present in a spreadsheet to see an overview of each trails information

| End result was a google doc that was nicley formatted| <img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/7044060/64193781-7efeaf00-ce4b-11e9-82b8-038b7f8deca4.png" width="500"> |
