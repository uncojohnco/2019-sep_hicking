# Web Scrape - alltrails.com

Organised a camp to Mont-Orford National Park in 2019 Sep. We wanted to do a few hikes, 
hence, wanted a way to have an overview of the trails near [Mont-Orford National Park](https://www.alltrails.com/parks/canada/quebec/mont-orford-national-park)

## Problem

The site [alltrails.com](https://www.alltrails.com) doesn't present an overview of relevant trails with rich data =\

## Solution

Used the below packages:

- BeautifulSoup
- Pandas
- Jupyter

To scrape the data from [alltrails.com](https://www.alltrails.com) and present in a csv to see an overview of each trails information
